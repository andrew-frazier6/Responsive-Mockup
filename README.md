## RESPONSIVE MOCKUP

Take a look https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/Responsive-Mockup/

## ABOUT

- The project was a choice of different mocks to work with. No effects were necesary, just a simple re-creation. The mock was built with HTML, CSS.

## VISUAL CHOICES

- Despite only having to fulfill the required inital mock, I went forward with adding a figcaption to all the photos. They all dipslay a film over top with a button. I wanted to show what the functionality of the mock would possibly feel like.

## ROADMAP

- Going forward I will add a slider of photos and testimonials, though I started with just an svg to show what its outlook would be like

## FINAL FEELINGS

- I am happy with the progression of the site and feel that with more tweaking the site could become a great resort page with great interaction on the user side.
